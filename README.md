# Network Security Fundamentals - Lab 1

Overview
This project documents **Lab 1: Network Security Fundamentals**, performed using **Kali Linux** and **Metasploitable 2**.  
The objective was to demonstrate core cybersecurity concepts—**Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)**—through encryption, reconnaissance, brute force, exploitation, and defense.

### 🧪 Lab Steps
1. **Encryption/Decryption** – Tested AES-256 using OpenSSL  
2. **Reconnaissance** – Scanned Metasploitable with Nmap  
3. **Brute Force Attack** – Used Hydra against FTP service  
4. **Exploitation** – Gained root shell using Metasploit `vsftpd_234_backdoor`  
5. **Defense** – Applied `iptables` to block FTP and restore system security
